TextMate Reporters
-------------------

These are reporter files you can integrate into your own bundles and alter as you see fit. You'll need to write your own commands for these and alter the paths to your nodelint.js files. For more information see the [wiki][wiki].

If all this sounds like just too much work, feel free to download and install the [TM bundle][bundle]. It comes packaged with nodelint.js and all the fun.
